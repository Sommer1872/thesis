# Swiss non-equivalence and market liquidity

This repo contains code for my master's thesis.

## Abstract

The non-equivalence of the Swiss stock exchange did not deteriorate liquidity on the venue, despite a lower activity of high-frequency algorithms. This paper reveals that after the ban on trading Swiss equities on EU exchanges, smaller amounts get posted to the order books, and the orders remain there for longer until execution or deletion. At the same time, the traded volume on the Swiss exchange increased due to market participants no longer being allowed to trade on competing venues. Despite these substantial changes, spread and depth measures indicating transaction costs and liquidity conditions remained stable.
